# Multithreading-vs-Multiprocessing
A comparison between multithreading and multiprocessing is done . 


OBJECTIVE:
This project mainly focuses on the differences between multithreading and multiprocessing. The performance comparison will be observed by the implementation of FOUR different series algorithms :

Fibonacci Series
Trag Series 
Lazy Caterer Series
Catalan Series

INTRODUCTION:

Comparison will be shown on the basis of speed and input (number of elements in the series). All the above mentioned algorithms have been implemented using multithreading and multiprocessing along with the use of pipes.
